We're thrilled to announce a significant update to our platform, bringing you more control and
flexibility in managing your organization. Starting today, you can assign roles to members of your
organization or create custom roles that fit your team perfectly.

## System roles

System roles are predefined roles that cannot be modified or deleted. There are two system roles:

- **Admin** - has full access to all organization resources, including billing and team management.
- **Viewer** - has read-only access to the registry, usage analytics and basic organization
  resources.

## Custom roles

Users with access to the organization members page can create custom roles. As Admin and Viewer
roles are not enough to cover all possible scenarios, custom roles allow you to create a role that
fits your team perfectly.

## Member invitation

When inviting a new member, you can select one of the roles available in your organization.

## Smooth Migration Story

We tried to make the transition to the new system as smooth as possible, so we've come up with the
following migration path:

1. First of all, members of your organization will keep their current permissions.
2. Some of the members will be assigned to the `Admin` or `Viewer` roles, but only if their
   permissions match the role's (e.g. a member has full access will be assigned to the `Admin`
   role).
3. Members that our system could't assign to any of the system roles, won't have any role assigned.
4. Pending invitations won't be canceled, the invited members will be assigned to `Viewer` role
   after accepting the invitation.
5. Use Migration Wizard to assign roles to members, or to create custom roles for them. Migration
   Wizard groups members by their permissions, so you can easily assign roles to multiple members at
   once.

<Callout type="warning">
  The Migration Wizard will be available for next 60 days. After that time, all members without a
  role will be assigned to the `Viewer` role.
